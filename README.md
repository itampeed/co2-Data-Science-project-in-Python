# Carbon Emissions Dashboard

This project is a Data Science project developed in Python to evaluate carbon emissions by continents. It includes an interactive dashboard that displays statistics using various types of charts such as scatter plots, bar plots, and linear plots, along with a year slider for selecting specific year to show data by year.
